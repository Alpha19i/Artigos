# Simple things that make a big difference later

I remember when I started to study Java in the beginning of Computer Science course. I came across with a phrase more or less like: "how to add Java to Windows path".

Similarly to every young and inexperienced apprentice I completely ignored this configuration part. I did not care to know how to add or even why I had to add Java to the so called Windows path. I started with a "straight to the point" attitude eager to start practicing on some IDE. If I made this path configuration or if it was automatically configured I can't recall.

The fact is by ignoring this part I ended ignoring the, possibly, more important concept: why do we need to add the installation path to the Windows path variable? I confess to my shame I let this question hovering over my life until not much time ago when I started learning Python.

Suddenly I came across with the need of installing some Python library. In most cases the instruction is basically: "write **pip install library**". A question arose: where do I write this? Until then everything I've been installing was through their own installation software.

After some investigation I found out: I had to write it on the command prompt. Then another question arose: ok, I already know where to write but is not there anything to do before? Or do I just need to open the prompt and write it? Don't I need any cd.. or anything like this? Is there no need to load this pip from somewhere?

The majority of you readres are now realizing how simple concepts I had to have learned much, much time ago were blocking me to comprehend such little and simple things. To those readers who haven't understand my issue yet I'll explain.

When we add Java or Python, or any other programming language to the Windows path we are actually configuring an environment variable. Roughly speaking, by configuring this path variable we allow Windows to find these language executables, be they compilers, interpreters, etc.

Note that most of the time after this path variable configuration we get a following instruction to write something in the command prompt. This is the instruction to verify if Windows correctly detected the executable of the language we added. From now on if everything was correctly configured we shall be able to execute codes in the *old fashion* way.

Thus, having I finally learned this so simple and necessary concept a new world opened to me. All of a sudden I stopped being someone completely dependent on GUI and started to see myself as a skilled hacker for just understand and follow simple instructions via command line.

This "evolution", although late, also served me to another important thing. Now, as teacher, I seek to emphasize important concepts even those small and simple allowing my students (those who pay attention, obviously) to tread a faster and with more quality evolution path than mine.
